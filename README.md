## UX(User Experience)
### First time User Goals:
As a first time user, I would like to:
1. Have clear instructions on what I need to do
2. Choose an option, and that option display as expected
3. Learn or remind myself of the rules
4. Go straight to playing the game if I already know the rules
5. Be able to see a tally of my score
6. Be able to play again or exit the game if I am finished

### Developer Goals:
As a developer, I would like:
1. To make the game more personal, by asking the user's name
2. Make the options clear and consise for the user to choose from
3. Have the rules as an option, so players can go straight to gameplay should they already be familiar with the rules
4. Give the computer a bit of personality for better user experience ie.The computer will call the user by their name

### Return User Goals:
As a return user, I would like to:
1. Add some here
